## What was Perception?

Perception was an interactive experience/puzzle game that ran from Jan - March 2017. The game was played out in physical space and controlled by players over the internet using a web interface. 

The player was tasked with solving puzzles by controlling a robot in an enclosed arena. The puzzles involved a mix of visual and physical challenges. The player had to avoid tipping over or running out of battery, both of which would trigger a game over. To charge the robot, the player needed to carefully reverse onto the charging bay until the text indicator showsed that the robot was charging. The player was able to speak via the robot to answer questions and talk to an AI that acted as the player's guide.
